            New civilization after Mayan prophecy for 2012

          <div class="page-content">
            <p>
              Mentioning Mayan prophecy, we will conjure up 2012, the end of the world. Yet, now, it is already 2021 and the
              world is still there safe and sound. In fact, the Mayan prophecy over 2012 indicated the demise of the old
              human
              civilization, not the world. On the contrary, it embraced the start of a new world.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Rainbow City" believes
              Satoshi's invention of Bitcoin in 2019 gloriously brought the digital Bit civilization and a higher human
              civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once upon a time, the Mayans in America had incredible foreseen what would happen in human society
              today. This is the prediction of the “Great Cycle” in the Mayan sacred calendar “Tzolkin”.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Great Cycle is the
              period from 3113 B.C. to 2012 A.D. when the earth and the solar system were passing a beam of Galactic Cosmic
              Rays.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, it's predicted that in the last two decades of the Great Cycle (1992-2012), the Earth
              Regeneration Period, two vital events would occur: new awakening human beings capable of resonating with the
              universe and the purification and regeneration of the earth.
            </p>
            <p>In the process of the renewal, the earth, including
              human mind, will be refined. Laggard substances will be eliminated and enhanced parts reserved. Maya hold it
              the
              inexorable law of the Milky Way, just as the alternation of the four seasons cannot be resisted.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the
              stage,
              the earth will go out of the scope of the galactic rays and the entire solar system will enter the predicted
              new
              phase of Galactic Synchronization with mankind forging ahead with the civilization upgrading.
            </p>
            <p>
              Actually, Mayan
              prophecy of 2012 means the extermination of the third-dimensional earth. That is, the earth will ascend to the
              fourth even the fifth level and become a purer planet where humans are more intellectual and can echo with the
              cosmos.
            </p>
            <p>
              The earth was in the third dimension. After 2012, the earth’s magnetic field will be lifted and gradually
              step into the fourth dimension, which is equal to three-dimensional space plus one-dimensional time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third
              dimension is the space in which we live whereas the fourth marks the addition of the time axis. Under the
              gravitational force of the earth and other large planets or stars, space-time will contort thereby the former
              will
              be knocked out and the latter is required.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the Maya’s Long Count Calender，December 21, 2012 will be the end of this cycle of human
              civilization, and mankind will enter a brand new civilization. With reference to Maya predictions and in-depth
              research on Bitcoin and blockchain, “Rainbow City” believes that the "digital Bit civilization" established by
              Satoshi Nakamoto is the new human civilization predicted by the Maya.
            </p>
            <p>
              In comparison to the Mayan prophecy and the incisive understanding of Bitcoin and blockchain, Rainbow City
              conceives the notion that the digital Bit civilization established by Satoshi is the new human civilization
              predicted by Maya.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now digital currency has been applied worldwide and the blockchain tech attained the recognition of various
              countries, formatting and purifying the entire globe. Explicitly, a brand-new human civilization has arrived.
            </p>
            <p>
              Human civilization will also evolve from a carbon-based civilization to a silicon-based one, permeating into
              human production and distribution. The essence of the blockchain is a database, which mechanized and digitized
              mankind. But it's not merely for humans, machines and AI have access to it as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              The future blockchain built is of sci-fi digital social ecosystem, linking the atomic physical world of
              carbon-based civilization and the digital Bitcoin space of silicon-based civilization. Blockchain created a
              language shared by human beings and artificial intelligence thereafter human and human, human and machine,
              machine and machine can all cooperate with each other in the Bitcoin world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only when silicon-based life forms emerge and participate in social division of labor, can human civilization
              exceed earth civilization, truly setting foot on cosmic civilization. Crucially, the open data of blockchain
              is
              the soil where silicon-based life forms sprout and thrive.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin. In 2012, the moving earth and solar system passed a beam of
              galactic
              rays from the core of the galaxy. After the renewal period of the earth, two major events will occur for
              mankind: the purification and regeneration of the earth, and the emergence of new human beings that can
              resonate
              with the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
              If blockchain's formatting the entire earth civilization is the purification and regeneration of the earth,
              then
              where are the new humans who can resonate with the universe?
            </p>
            <p>
              Rainbow City harbors the idea that those new humans are rainbow warriors who have been preaching for Satoshi
              Nakamoto, for Bitcoin and for blockchain！
            </p>
            <p>
              Now let us take a closer look at another Mayan prophecy in regard to the rainbow warriors.
            </p>

            Ancient Mayan prophecy <br> the emergence of Rainbow warrior
          </div>
          <div class="page-content">
            <p>
              In November 1995, a solemn gathering ceremony for the elders from all the indigenous tribes of the Maya. Don
              Alejandro of Guatemala announced an exciting news: Rainbow warrior is about to turn up.
            </p>
            <p>
              The story of rainbow
              warrior dates back to another ancient Mayan prophecy passed down from generation to generation.
            </p>
            <p>
              It says that
              humans with light skin will land the east coast of America to conquer the Indians. Unfortunately, there's
              simply nothing they can do to stop these greedy predators.
            </p>
            <p>
              But at this time, the dawn is breaking on the
              horizon of the East and the Indians regain strength, self-esteem and wisdom.
            </p>
            <p>
            <p>
              Together with throngs of
              light-skinned friends, they begin to devote themselves to the improvement of the earth under the leadership of
              rainbow, mankind of all races and all religions collaborate to spread the concept that humans should live in
              harmony with nature. Anyone equipped with the concept will be called as “rainbow warrior”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Warriors as they
              are, they won't hurt others since inherits the wisdom and benevolence from their ancestors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Praising virtue
              and punishing vice through the fierce non-violent struggle, they prevent the destruction and disintegration of
              the earth ultimately and bring the world peace, prosperity and a new belief.
            </p>
            <p>
              The above is the Rainbow Warrior
              part in the Mayan prophecy and exactly the belief and mission of Rainbow Warrior of Rainbow City, the prophecy
              in Bible about doomsday and New Jerusalem.
            </p>
            <p>
              After thousands of years of evolution, human civilization is facing
              division and collapse. In 2009, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, which opened a new era, and
              human civilization began to enter the "digital Bitcoin era".
            </p>
            <p>
              In this great era of civilization enhancement, a
              group of Satoshi Nakamoto's believers made up their mind to re-establish the rainbow contract with God and
              recreate the Tower of Babel, namely, Rainbow City. This time we plan to have Satoshi Nakamoto's name up, the
              Creator of the Bitcoin world, not human beings'.
            </p>
            <p>
              We want to make another contract with God in the name of
              "Rainbow", and the "Rainbow City" we created is a Bitcoin civilized digital city-state based on "Token
              Economy" and "Community Governance". In the system of "Rainbow City", we will issue "Rainbow Token-RBT", and
              community members who have "Rainbow Token-RBT" will all be called "Rainbow Warriors". The "Rainbow Warriors"
              defend the consensus that man and nature live in harmony. This is the Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin consensus!
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the leadership of "Rainbow", different beliefs and races will unite to spread the concept that human
              beings should live in harmony with nature. Anyone with this consciousness can become a "Rainbow Warrior" who
              are able to resonate with the consciousness of the universe,and promote the earth’s civilization into the
              dimension of time.
